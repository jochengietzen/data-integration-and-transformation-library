# Focus around Dependency injection
- Table read function
- Table write function

    Have to be injectable, but also verifyable, so taht we can ensure, all calls of that function get the required parameters. => Fail early (possible later feature though)

- Schemadefinition
    - Provide own data type, that can map to various package datatypes
    - 

- Allow injection/definition of standard parameters, that are always injected into the runtime/executions
